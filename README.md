### Features beyond requirements
Added a delete button

As a design decision, I made completed date be based only on when the checkbox is pressed and only alterable if the checkbox is unpressed and pressed again. If I were to have implemented it such that the completed date has a datepicker similar to that of due date, I would follow the same format as I do for allowing change to the due date.

### Features beyond requirements
Added a delete button

As a design decision, I made completed date be based only on when the checkbox is pressed and only alterable if the checkbox is unpressed and pressed again. If I were to have implemented it such that the completed date has a datepicker similar to that of due date, I would follow the same format as I do for allowing change to the due date.

### Takeaways from Project
Learning React/React Native has been on my "bucket list" for a long time. This was a great opportunity to do just that. It was really fun learning how to write in React Native and JavaScript. The most fun part of it was doing the programmatic UI design. I felt like I really had to understand how the Views worked for me to comfortably make changes that I saw fit, and it was cool once I got the hang of it. I need more practice, but this was definitely a good start. The hardest part was understanding how hooks worked. It's just one of those intangible concepts, but I understood its usefulness and took more time trying to understand that than anything else. If I were to do this project again, I would definitely try using a different method of storage, only because I know that there are other options I could have used, and it would be fun to explore them.
